# E.C.O.PhaseOne_SucculentGarden<h1>

  <h5> I was inspired by a PyOhio Speaker to start studying plant life with Machine
  Learning Models and Technology. I am using mainly python code, and plan on seeing what 
   kind of information I come up with. My sensors will pick up live data that I will be storing
   in a database. I am using a controled environment for Phase One of my ECO project which is 
  the succulant garden. I was planning on bringing in atleast one cloned project and that is the NDVI conversion 
  code https://github.com/p-v-o-s/infrapix?fbclid=IwAR3QGaMjfOLytR2NiEgOu_4HDYrjk3LKvlxqtVIX-wE_C9rycnBF7lfJDSc , but I have descided to do my own and use this as a reference point.<h5>
  
<h6> From that information I plan on getting a realistic scope on the photosynthisis process by succulents. From the Camera alone
  I will get photosynthisis information from *NDVI conversion* & *NDR conversion*, plant identification, vector information, growth rate and decay rate. Hopefully with the collaboration of the other collected data, I can learn the maximum and minimums of watering, fertilizing. What do plants do when they are happy? How do succulants stay happy in dry conditions? Some of the other data I will be collecting is moisture, gas, UV (which is essential collaboration data to the NDVI conversion data), temperature, humidity. You can click on the links to read up on all the data on the links provided in the inventory list about the sensors. You can also play with the sensors yourself with sample code that is listed on the sites in the inventory list. <h6>
